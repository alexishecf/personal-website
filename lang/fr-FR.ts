  about_paragraph: "Hi, I'm Alexis Hecfeuille, a passionate software developer based in France and working on web projects as a full stack developer.{br}{br}When I was around 12 years old, I always had ideas of things to build or improve, mainly from video games I played. The will to turn these ideas into real things is what got me interested in computer science and development. Later, I studied computer science at the university of Lille, where I got a Master of Science.{br}{br}During my studies, I co-founded a company called hologame, which develops a turnkey solution of free-roam virtual reality arena and sells it to entertainment venues. It's kind of an updated version of the laser tag concept, where we kept the good aspects (i.e. immersion and free-roam) and added the infinite possibilities of virtual reality. I was the technical co-founder and developed the networked virtual reality game as well as the various web applications used by arena operators and end users to play it.{br}{br}I love experimenting and learning new things. A few topics I'd like to dig into are cryptography, home automation, bioinformatics and human augmentation.",

  work_hologame_paragraph: "Hologame is the company I co-founded while I was studying computer science at the University of Lille. It develops a turnkey solution of free-roam virtual reality arena and sells it to entertainment venues.{br}{br}The idea was born out of the frustration we felt playing laser tag, the concept was fun but it was severely outdated and very limited in environment possibilities as well as in game modes and opponent types, which were strictly limited to other human players. With the significant advancements in virtual reality and the emergence of standalone HMDs with six degrees of freedom, I thought it would be a good idea to mix it with the laser tag concept to provide a highly immersive experience with an infinite amount of possibilities.{br}{br}My role was that of technical co-founder, I built the initial prototype which consisted of a VR POC game developed with Unity, and later I built the first marketable version of hologame: the networked free-roam VR game, the web application used by the arena operators to manage the sessions, the authentication application used by the end-users, the backend used to connect all these applications, the website and some other internal applications.{br}{br}Hologame is played on large surfaces of 300+m², in a physically empty but virtually filled arena, where you must either team up against hordes of zombies or fight each other.",
